# weather-dashboard

## Description

This webpage uses HTML and CSS code to create a weather dashboard that is updated dynamically and retrieves data from Open Weather's 5 Day Forecast API. 

The webpage provides the outlook for multiple cities to provide the user with the necessary information to plan a potential trip

* When the user searches for a city, they are presented with current conditions and a 5 day forecast, with each city added locally to the search history 
* Within the current conditions, users will see the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
* When the user views the 5 day forecast for the selected city, they will see the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* When a city is locally stored to the search history, the user can click on it to bring back up that city's current and 5 day forecast
